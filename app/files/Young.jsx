        <p className='text-start lg:text-2xl text-xs'>At our school, we are committed to providing quality education to children from nearby villages who otherwise lack access to proper schooling. Our focus is on reaching out to those who are most in need: children with health problems, orphans, and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
            <br />
            <br />
Inclusivity and Support: We believe that every child deserves a chance to learn and grow. Thatâ€™s why we offer free education to children who cannot afford school fees, ensuring that financial barriers do not stand in the way of their future. Our dedicated program to educate a girl child is especially close to our hearts, as we work to empower young girls from poor and needy backgrounds by giving them the education they deserve, completely free of cost.
<br />
<br />
Holistic Care: Our commitment goes beyond just academics. We provide a nurturing environment that takes into account the physical and emotional well-being of every child. By offering this comprehensive support, we aim to create a solid foundation for these young minds, preparing them for a brighter and more hopeful future.
